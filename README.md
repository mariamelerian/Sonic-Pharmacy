## Code Examples

## Backend (node js)

### Registering as a Pharmacist

Below is a Node.js function for a guest to create an account as a pharmacist.

```javascript
const registerPharmacist = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // const { username, email, password } = req.body;
    const username = req.body.username;
    const password = req.body.password;
    const email = req.body.email;
    const education = req.body.education;
    const hourlyRate = req.body.hourlyRate;
    const dateOfBirth = req.body.dateOfBirth;
    const name = req.body.name;
    const affiliation = req.body.affiliation;
    // Debugging: log the received data
    console.log("Received data:", req.body);

    req.body.files = req.locals?.docs;
    const files = req.body.files;

    // Validate username
    const validation = await validateUsername(username);

    //Check if username exists
    if (!validation) {
      return res.status(408).send("Username already exists");
    }

    // Check if email exists
    const existingPharmacist = await Pharmacist.findOne({ email });
    if (existingPharmacist) {
      return res.status(409).json({ message: "Email is already registered" });
    }

    // Debugging: log the password before hashing
    console.log("Password before hashing:", password);

    // Hash the password
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

    // Debugging: log the hashed password
    console.log("Hashed password:", hashedPassword);

    // Create a new Pharmacist instance with the modified request body
    const newPharmacist = new Pharmacist({
      username,
      email,
      password: hashedPassword,
      picture: req.body.picture,
      education,
      hourlyRate,
      affiliation,
      dateOfBirth,
      name,
      files,
    });

    // Save the Pharmacist instance
    await newPharmacist.save();

    console.log("before");

    // Upload documents and associate them with the pharmacist
    // uploadDocuments(req.body, res, newPharmacist._id);

    return res.status(201).json(newPharmacist);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
};
```

### Changing Your Password as a Patient

The following is a Node.js function that demonstrates how a patient can change their password.

```javascript
const patientChangePassword = async (req, res) => {
  const user = await Patient.findById(req.session.userId);
  console.log("change password " + user);

  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: "Patient not found" });
  }

  const { oldPassword, newPassword } = req.body;
  console.log(oldPassword);

  // Check if the old password is correct
  const isPasswordCorrect = await bcrypt.compare(oldPassword, user.password);
  console.log(isPasswordCorrect);

  if (!isPasswordCorrect) {
    return res.status(409).json({ error: "Invalid old password" });
  }

  // Hash the new password and update the user's document
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(newPassword, 10);

  user.password = hashedPassword;

  console.log(user.password);
  await user.save();

  return res.status(200).json({ message: "Password updated successfully" });
};
```

### Getting Alternative Medicine

The following Node.js function returns alternavies for out of stock medicine using the same active ingredient.

```javascript
const getAlternativeMedicines = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { medicineId } = req.body; // Get the ID of the specified medicine from the request body
    const medicine = await Medicine.findOne({ _id: medicineId }); // Find the specified medicine in the database
    if (!medicine) res.status(404).json({ message: "Medicine not found" });
    const alternativeMedicines = await Medicine.find({
      activeIngredients: { $in: medicine.activeIngredients },
      state: "Active",
    }); // Find all medicines that contain any of the active ingredients of the specified medicine
    if (!alternativeMedicines)
      res.status(409).json({ message: "No Alternative Medicines" });
    const index = alternativeMedicines.findIndex(
      (med) => med._id.toString() === medicineId
    ); // Find the index of the specified medicine in the list of alternative medicines
    if (index !== -1) {
      // If the specified medicine is found in the list of alternative medicines
      alternativeMedicines.splice(index, 1);
    }

    res.send(alternativeMedicines); // Return the list of alternative medicines in the response body
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```

## Status Build

### Current Issues

1. **Long Loading Time:**

   - Users may experience extended loading times during certain interactions. We are actively working to optimize performance and enhance the overall user experience.

2. **Code Structure Enhancement:**

   - The code structure is functional but could benefit from further enhancement for better readability, maintainability, and scalability. We appreciate your patience as we strive to improve the codebase.

3. **Platform Linking:**

   - The linkage between platforms needs refinement. Our team acknowledges the importance of seamless integration, and we are committed to enhancing the connection between different components for a smoother user experience.

4. **Chat Construction Using Arrays:**

   - The construction of chats currently relies on arrays, which may impact efficiency. We are exploring alternative approaches to optimize chat construction and ensure real-time communication.

5. **Cart Management:**

   - Users currently cannot add or remove multiple items from their carts with quick successive clicks, they must wait for a couple of seconds before they can perform the operation again. We are actively working to resolve this delay.

6. **Delayed Notifications:**

   - Users currently cannot view new notifications without refreshing the page first.We understand the importance of this feature and are working to address this limitation.

7. **Authentication Method:**
   - Request authentication utilizes express session and not token. We are actively working to resolve this issue.

### Next Steps

Our development team is actively working on addressing the identified issues and implementing improvements. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we strive to make the necessary enhancements to deliver a more robust and user-friendly application.
